title: Sunday thoughts- part 1
---

1. There is a constant battle within me whether to express myself in public( social platforms) or not. On the one hand, I have a natural desire to write  and express. On the other hand, an instinct to keep my thoughts to myself. It’s similar to the trending meme “feeling cute now, might delete later”. I have reverted many of my blog to draft days after publishing it. The battle is real. 

2. I spend almost 4 hours a day commuting from home to work and back. That’s a lot of time I am wasting. And at the end of the day, I am so tired, I just eat and sleep, just to wake up the next morning to repeat the cycle. At the end of the week, I am so tired, I just sleep through the weekends, missing out on all the fun things I could do. I need to break this predicament. I don’t know how.
