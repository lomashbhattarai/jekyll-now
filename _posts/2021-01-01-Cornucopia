I believe utopia is possible. I believe magic is possible. I believe all of humanity can enjoy the fruits from a cornucopia.

The fact that one grain of rice can produce a thousand grains. The fact the a branch from a tree can grow to become a tree in itself. The fact the so many varieties of fruits exists in the world. All of this is magic to me. The elements required for a cornucopia is already there in nature. We just need to wield it to bring to existence. 

To a hunter gatherer who died because of famine or drought, present day society would have been their utopian dream. 

All that  is needed is for us to define our utopia. To dream. And then strive to achieve the dream. Because what we have now is no less a magic. The world is built with magical forces. We have magic at our disposal already - our mind, our body, the nature. 
All we have to do is wield them to our needs, to our highest aspirations.
